# CoffeePrices

## Code Kentucky Data Analysis with Python part 1 project

This project is for my Code Kentucky class. I will be cleaning and visualizing this data using Anaconda and a JupyterNotebook. Using Python and tools such as NumPy, Pandas, 
and Matplotlib. To give you a look at America's Favorite Drink COFFEE!! This data was read in from a csv file from Kaggle. 
See link blow to visit page.

### Overview and how to.

* In this notebook I will be using Python and and Jupyternotebook to show the daliy prices of coffee over a two year time span.
  We will be using libraries like pandas and matploitlib. With these tools I will take this large dataset and make it more readable and visually
  pleasing.

* To run this notebook you will need to clone this Github repository.
  Then pip install the Lirbraries that are listed below.
  I have also left a link in this readme to the raw data so you can compare.
